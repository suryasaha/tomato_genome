== 1. Introduction ==

The ITAG2.4 release of the official Tomato genome annotation (ITAG2.4), 
is a post-release update to ITAG2.3 covering approximately 84% of the genome,
with 34,725 gene models. This release includes updates to the gap sizes 
between scaffolds from FISH experiments.

This release file set was generated on February 23, 2014.

Please note that ITAG2.4 corresponds to build 2.5 of the tomato genome and ITAG2.3
corresponds to build 2.4. The genome release numbers and ITAG versions are NOT 
synchronized.

Please see ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/ITAG2.3_release/ITAG2.3_README.txt
for detailed description and statistics of ITAG2.3.

  GFF version 3 file containing alignments to other genomes or
  assemblies other than the one used as reference for this annotation.

  Analyses in this file:
    ITAG_itag1_ref

* ITAG2.4_protein_reference.gff3
  GFF version 3 file containing reference features for each protein
  sequence.  Useful for loading features on the protein sequences into
  databases like Chado.

  Analyses in this file:
    none

* ITAG2.4_proteins.fasta
  fasta-format sequence file of protein sequences.

* ITAG2.4_proteins_full_desc.fasta

* ITAG2.4_repeats.gff3
  GFF version 3 file containing repetitive regions, at 'normal'
  stringency, meaning running it *with* the -nolow option, so that
  low-complexity and simple repeats are NOT masked.  The repeat set
  used for masking is available at
  ftp://ftp.sgn.cornell.edu/genomes/Solanum_lycopersicum/repeats/mipsREdat_8.8_solanaceae_TE.masked.gz.
     
  Analyses in this file:
    ITAG_repeats

* ITAG2.4_repeats_aggressive.gff3
  GFF version 3 file containing repetitive regions, at 'aggressive'
  stringency, meaning running it *without* the -nolow option, so that
  low-complexity and simple repeats ARE masked.  The repeat set used
  for masking is available at
  ftp://ftp.sgn.cornell.edu/genomes/Solanum_lycopersicum/repeats/mipsREdat_8.8_eudico_TEs.masked.gz.
