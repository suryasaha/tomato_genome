== 1. Introduction ==

The ITAG2.4 release of the official Tomato genome annotation (ITAG2.4), 
is a post-release update to ITAG2.3 covering approximately 84% of the genome,
with 34,725 gene models. This release includes updates to the gap sizes 
between scaffolds from FISH experiments.

This release file set was generated on February 23, 2014.

Please note that ITAG2.4 corresponds to build 2.5 of the tomato genome and ITAG2.3
corresponds to build 2.4. The genome release numbers and ITAG versions are not 
synchronized.
